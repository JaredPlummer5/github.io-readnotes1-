# Engineering Readings

## Value your time

- We often don't realize how valuable our time is and end up wasting it on useless stuff. Like, seriously, we do all these things that don't even help us get closer to our goals or make us happy. We give away our time and energy to people who just take advantage of us.

- Busy doesn't necessarily mean being productive or focused. It's easy to let our world and the people around us consume all our time if we don't prioritize and manage it wisely. Our time is valuable, just like our paycheck, and if we don't budget it properly, we'll end up with nothing left by the end of the day.

- Being busy can be a form of mental laziness because it means we're not consciously choosing how to spend our time. The most successful people, as mentioned by author Jeff Goins, are not just busy; they're focused. They know what truly matters to them and take tangible action steps towards those things.

- When we're constantly busy, we're on autopilot, and time slips away without us even realizing it. We can't get back those hours that are wasted on unimportant tasks or ungrateful people. The ancient philosopher Seneca emphasized that those who are preoccupied with things that don't truly matter have the most wretched lives. We need to reflect on how small a portion of our lives belongs to us and take charge of our time.

- So, the key question is: Who's in control of your time? Is it you or everyone else? It's essential to be proactive, focused, and intentional with our time to ensure we're using it wisely and pursuing what truly matters to us.

- Busyness is often misunderstood and overvalued. Many people take pride in being busy, thinking it's a sign of importance or productivity. However, in reality, busyness can be a form of distraction and procrastination, keeping us away from what truly matters. Successful individuals see busyness and stress as enemies because they indicate being off-track and lacking discipline. They prioritize their goals and focus on them consistently, avoiding busywork and distractions.

- In the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport, it's highlighted that achieving highly productive results requires removing all distractions and entering a state of deep focus. Busyness and exhaustion are not signs of success; they suggest that something is not right. The key is to do less but with complete, intense concentration. After completing work, it's important to disconnect and enjoy the rest of the day.

- Deep work involves eliminating distractions and producing exceptional quality and quantity in a short amount of time. It's about achieving more through focused efforts rather than spending more time on unfocused tasks. If you desire incredible productivity, you need to cultivate extreme focus in everything you do. It's crucial to take control of your time because if you don't manage it, it will manage you.

- When you have limited time available, you must make better choices about what to work on and what to prioritize. The goal is to be efficient and effective in utilizing your time and energy.

- Saying "no" allows successful individuals to prioritize their time and energy on what truly matters. It's about distinguishing between good ideas and great opportunities. Steve Jobs emphasized that focus means saying "no" to the hundred other good ideas to choose carefully and pursue innovation.

- When you value your time at $1,000 per hour, it becomes easier to decide which tasks or opportunities are truly worth your attention. If you can honestly justify doing something for that value, it's likely a good choice.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The one thing you bring to your career and a potential employer that nobody else can is your ability to effectively manage your time and prioritize tasks. By valuing your time and saying "no" to distractions or unimportant opportunities, you can focus on what truly matters and make significant progress towards your goals. This level of discipline and strategic decision-making sets you apart from others and allows you to maximize your productivity and effectiveness.

### When you find yourself stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature, here are three things you can start doing to "un-stick" yourself:

    1. Take a step back and gain perspective: Sometimes, getting too immersed in a problem can hinder your progress. Take a break, clear your mind, and approach the issue with a fresh perspective. Engage in activities like going for a walk, meditating, or doing something unrelated to programming to recharge your mind.

    2. Seek assistance and collaborate: Don't hesitate to reach out for help or collaborate with others. Consult your colleagues, join relevant forums or online communities, or seek mentorship from more experienced developers. Often, discussing the problem with others can provide new insights and solutions.

    3. Break it down into smaller tasks: Complex problems can be overwhelming, but breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks can make them more approachable. Focus on solving each smaller piece individually, and gradually build up to the larger problem. This approach can help you make progress and gain confidence along the way.

## Think like a programmer

- Problem-solving is a crucial skill that holds significant value in various domains, including coding and employment in general. Many people approach problem-solving in a haphazard and random manner, trying different solutions without a structured approach. However, this can lead to inefficiency and wasted time.

- To effectively solve problems, it is essential to have a systematic framework in place and practice it regularly. Employers highly prioritize problem-solving skills when seeking qualified candidates. These skills are often considered more important than technical proficiency in programming languages, debugging, or system design.

- Employing computational thinking or the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components is highly valuable. It demonstrates a deeper understanding and an analytical approach to problem-solving, which is often more crucial than just having technical knowledge.

- By honing problem-solving skills, developing a framework, and actively practicing problem-solving techniques, individuals can enhance their problem-solving abilities. This not only benefits their coding or technical expertise but also makes them more attractive to employers across various industries.

To approach a new problem, the following steps are recommended: 

Firstly, it's crucial to fully understand the problem by being able to explain it in simple terms. Writing it down, creating diagrams, or discussing it with others can help gain clarity. 

Secondly, planning the solution is essential. Taking the time to analyze the problem and define the exact steps required for the solution is important before diving into coding or implementation.

The third step is to divide the problem into sub-problems. Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts makes it easier to solve. Address each sub-problem individually, starting with the simplest and gradually progressing to more complex ones. By solving each sub-problem, the overall solution to the original problem can be achieved.

If stuck at any point, three strategies can be employed:

    - First is the process of debugging, where the solution is examined step by step to identify errors or issues. 
    
    - Second, reassessing the problem from a different perspective or considering a more general approach can provide new insights. 
    
    - Finally, researching and seeking solutions to sub-problems (but not the entire problem) can be helpful. Learning from others' solutions contributes to growth and understanding.

Lastly, practice is emphasized as a crucial aspect of improving problem-solving skills. Regularly engaging in problem-solving activities, such as chess puzzles, math problems, or coding challenges, helps develop and strengthen problem-solving abilities. Practicing micro problem-solving in a preferred domain can lead to recognizing patterns and concepts applicable to broader problem-solving contexts.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The one thing you bring to your career and a potential employer that nobody else can is your ability to effectively apply the problem-solving framework discussed. By having a systematic approach to problem-solving, understanding problems deeply, planning solutions, dividing them into manageable sub-problems, and utilizing debugging and reassessment techniques, you can bring a unique problem-solving mindset. This skill set sets you apart from others and allows you to approach challenges with clarity, efficiency, and creativity.

### When you encounter a tough piece of code, logic, or feature and find yourself stuck, here are three things you can start doing to "un-stick" yourself:

- Take a step back and gain perspective: Pause and analyze the problem from a different angle. Look for alternative approaches or different ways to break down the problem. This fresh perspective can help uncover new insights or potential solutions.

- Seek assistance and collaborate: Don't hesitate to seek help from peers, mentors, or online communities. Discussing the problem with others can provide valuable insights, different viewpoints, and potential solutions you may not have considered. Collaboration can spark new ideas and approaches.

- Engage in deliberate practice and learning: Continuously invest in your problem-solving skills by practicing regularly and learning from diverse sources. Solve coding challenges, work on side projects, and explore different problem-solving domains. Embrace a growth mindset and constantly seek opportunities to expand your knowledge and skills.

## Solving Problems

Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the steps you can follow for algorithmic programming problems:

Step 1: Read the problem completely twice.

- Take the time to thoroughly understand the problem statement and its requirements. Read it carefully multiple times to ensure a clear comprehension.
- Pay attention to any constraints or special conditions mentioned in the problem.
- Make sure you have a solid grasp of what the problem is asking you to achieve.

Step 2: Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- Before jumping into writing code, manually solve the problem for at least three different sets of sample data.
- Work through the problem step by step, performing the necessary calculations or operations manually.
- This manual solving process helps you gain a deeper understanding of the problem and identify any potential patterns or insights.

Step 3: Optimize the manual steps.

- Once you have manually solved the problem, look for ways to optimize the steps you followed.
- Consider if there are any unnecessary or redundant operations that can be eliminated.
- Identify opportunities to streamline the process and make it more efficient.
- The goal is to find the most optimal approach to solving the problem manually before translating it into code.

Step 4: Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- Document the optimized manual steps as comments or write them in the form of pseudo-code.
- Pseudo-code is a high-level description of the steps without getting into the specifics of any programming language syntax.
- Focus on expressing the logic and algorithmic flow in a clear and understandable manner.

Step 5: Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

- Take the pseudo-code or commented steps and convert them into actual code using your chosen programming language.
- Translate the logical steps into code statements, variables, loops, and other necessary constructs.
- Ensure that the code aligns with the problem requirements and accurately represents the optimized manual solution.

Step 6: Optimize the real code.

- Once you have written the initial code, review it for any areas that can be further optimized.
- Look for opportunities to reduce unnecessary operations, improve time or space complexity, or enhance code readability.
- Optimize the code iteratively, testing and refining it until you are satisfied with its performance and efficiency.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The one thing you bring to your career and a potential employer that nobody else can is your structured and systematic problem-solving approach. By following the steps mentioned earlier, you demonstrate a unique ability to thoroughly understand problems, optimize solutions, and translate them into efficient code. This methodical approach sets you apart from others and showcases your ability to tackle complex challenges effectively.

When you get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature, here are three things you can start doing to "un-stick" yourself:

- Take a step back and review the problem: Give yourself some space and time to reassess the problem. Review the requirements, constraints, and any existing code. Ensure you have a clear understanding of the issue at hand before attempting to find a solution.

- Seek input and collaborate: Engage with your peers, mentors, or online communities to seek guidance or alternative perspectives. Share the problem and your thought process, and welcome their input. Collaborating with others can provide fresh insights, different approaches, or potential solutions that you may not have considered.

- Break it down and iterate: If you encounter a tough problem, break it down into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Tackle each sub-problem individually, focusing on solving one part at a time. Iterate through the solution, testing and refining as you go. This iterative approach allows you to make progress and learn from each step, leading you closer to the final solution.

## 5 Whys

The 5 Whys analysis is a simple and effective problem-solving tool that can be used for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem resolution. It is particularly useful for simple to moderately difficult problems but may not be suitable for complex or critical issues where a wider-ranging method may be more effective.

The 5 Whys technique involves asking "why" repeatedly to uncover the root cause of a problem. It helps direct you quickly to the underlying cause and can be applied before embarking on more in-depth problem-solving approaches. The simplicity of the tool allows for flexibility and it can be combined with other methods like Root Cause Analysis or Cause and Effect Analysis.

To use the 5 Whys, you assemble a team, define the problem, and ask the first "why." Then, for each answer generated, ask four more "whys" in succession to delve deeper into the underlying causes. Move through the questions quickly to gain a comprehensive understanding before jumping to conclusions. The process can follow a single lane of inquiry or multiple lanes, exploring different branches of analysis.

Knowing when to stop is crucial, and you have reached the root cause when further "why" questions do not yield useful responses. At this point, a counter-measure or process change should become evident. If there are multiple reasons identified, repeat the process for each branch of analysis until a root cause is determined.

In summary, the 5 Whys analysis is a valuable tool for quickly identifying the root cause of a problem. By asking "why" repeatedly, you can uncover underlying issues and develop effective solutions. Employing this method can contribute to troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem-solving efforts, making it a valuable skill to have in your problem-solving toolkit.

## The Super Mario Effect

In this TEDxPenn talk, the speaker shares his experience of creating a computer programming puzzle and observing the different approaches people took to solve it. He reveals that he intentionally served two versions of the puzzle, one penalizing failed attempts with a point deduction and the other not penalizing failures. The results showed that those who were not penalized had a higher success rate and made more attempts to solve the puzzle. The speaker refers to this phenomenon as the "Super Mario effect," where focusing on the end goal rather than the fear of failure leads to more success and learning.

The speaker emphasizes that this effect can be applied beyond gaming and learning coding. He shares examples from his own experiences, such as building complex projects and teaching science through engaging videos. By reframing challenges and adopting a game-like mindset, people can overcome the fear of failure and approach tasks with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn.

The speaker concludes by encouraging the audience to embrace the Super Mario effect in their own lives, shifting their focus from the fear of failure to the excitement of learning and achieving their goals.

In summary, the main idea of this talk is that by adopting a game-like mindset and focusing on the end goal rather than the fear of failure, individuals can increase their success rate and learn more effectively in various aspects of life.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The one thing you bring to your career and a potential employer that nobody else can is your ability to embrace the Super Mario effect. This means that you have developed a mindset that focuses on the end goal, sees failures as learning opportunities, and approaches challenges with enthusiasm and a willingness to try again. This unique perspective allows you to learn more, overcome obstacles, and achieve success in a way that sets you apart from others.

### To "un-stick" yourself whenever you get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature, here are three things you can start doing:

- Reframe the problem: Instead of viewing it as a roadblock or failure, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Shift your mindset to focus on finding a solution rather than dwelling on the difficulty of the task.

- Seek different perspectives: Don't hesitate to reach out to colleagues, online communities, or mentors for assistance. Explaining the problem to someone else or discussing it with others can provide fresh insights and ideas that might help you overcome the challenge.

- Break it down: When faced with a complex problem, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. By tackling each sub-task individually, you can make progress and build momentum. This approach allows you to focus on specific aspects of the problem and find solutions incrementally.
