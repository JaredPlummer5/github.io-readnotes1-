# The Growth Mindset

## Upgrading technical skills with deliberate practice

- This topic of "upgrading technical skills with deliberate practice" is incredibly important, particularly in a field such as software development where technology is constantly evolving. It matters in my studies because it emphasizes the necessity of active and conscious engagement in learning new skills, rather than passively absorbing information. This method of learning can be applied not just in software development, but in any area of study or profession that requires constant improvement and evolution of skills.

## The Power of Yet

The concept of "The Power of Yet" refers to a mindset that embraces growth and learning. The idea originated from a high school in Chicago where students who didn't pass a course received the grade "Not Yet" instead of a failing grade. This approach reframes failure as a temporary setback rather than a reflection of one's abilities.

The speaker highlights the importance of fostering a growth mindset in children and how it can influence their response to challenges and difficulties. Students with a growth mindset understand that their abilities can be developed through effort, perseverance, and the willingness to learn from mistakes. On the other hand, students with a fixed mindset view failure as a judgment on their intelligence, which leads to avoidance of challenges and a fear of making mistakes.

The speaker emphasizes the need to raise children who are not solely focused on achieving immediate success or external validation, such as getting high grades or awards. Instead, they suggest praising the process, effort, and improvement that children demonstrate. By doing so, children develop resilience and a willingness to take on difficult tasks.

The power of "yet" lies in its ability to instill confidence and provide a path for growth and progress. By teaching children that their abilities are not fixed but can be developed over time, they become more resilient, motivated, and open to embracing challenges. The speaker suggests various strategies for promoting a growth mindset, such as rewarding effort and progress instead of just the end result, creating engaging learning environments, and teaching students about the malleability of their brains.

The speaker also highlights the impact of a growth mindset on educational equality. By creating growth mindset classrooms that encourage the belief in students' potential for growth, significant improvements in academic performance have been observed, even among traditionally disadvantaged groups.

Overall, the message conveyed is that by embracing the power of "yet" and cultivating a growth mindset, we can create environments that support and inspire children to reach their full potential and overcome obstacles along the way.

## The power of passion and perseverance

The topic of grit and perseverance is highly relevant to various fields of study, including psychology, education, and personal development. In the context of this module, which focuses on personal growth and learning, understanding the role of grit becomes essential.

The speaker shares their experiences as a teacher and researcher, highlighting that success in school and in life goes beyond intelligence (IQ) and natural talent. Instead, they identify grit as a significant predictor of achievement. Grit refers to the passion and perseverance for long-term goals, the stamina to stay committed and work hard for years.

The speaker conducted studies in diverse settings, such as military training, spelling bees, and schools, consistently finding that grittier individuals were more likely to succeed. They also emphasize the importance of building grit in children and address the question of how to do so.

While the speaker acknowledges the limited understanding of how to cultivate grit, they mention the concept of a growth mindset as a promising approach. Developed by Carol Dweck, a growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through effort and learning. When students understand that failure is not a permanent condition but an opportunity for growth, they are more likely to persevere.

In conclusion, the topic of grit and perseverance is vital for personal growth and success. It reminds us that intelligence and talent alone are not sufficient, and that developing a resilient mindset and the ability to persist in the face of challenges is crucial. By exploring and testing various strategies, such as promoting a growth mindset, we can strive to cultivate grit in ourselves and others, ultimately enhancing our chances of achieving long-term goals.

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

The speaker discusses the phenomenon of career crises and the anxiety many individuals experience in relation to their careers. They describe how these crises often occur on Sunday evenings, when the gap between their aspirations and their current reality becomes painfully apparent. The speaker argues that career crises are not just personal issues but are prevalent in today's society, where there is a constant pressure to succeed and a fear of falling behind.

One of the reasons for career anxiety, according to the speaker, is the prevalence of snobbery. They explain that snobbery is a global phenomenon and that job snobbery is particularly pervasive. People often judge others based on their careers, and one's position in the social hierarchy becomes a measure of worth and respect. This societal pressure leads individuals to prioritize their careers and material possessions in the pursuit of validation and acceptance.

The speaker also explores how the high expectations of success and equality in modern society contribute to career anxiety. The belief that anyone can achieve anything can create a sense of envy and comparison with others. The proximity between individuals in terms of age, background, and aspirations intensifies the feelings of envy and competition. The speaker suggests that envy is a dominant emotion in modern society and that it is linked to the spirit of equality and the pressure to succeed.

Another factor contributing to career anxiety is the emphasis on meritocracy. While meritocracy is generally seen as a positive ideal, the speaker argues that it can also create a harsh reality. In a meritocratic society, success is seen as deserved and failure becomes deeply crushing. The pressure to prove oneself and the fear of being labeled a "loser" can lead to increased rates of suicide in individualistic societies.

The speaker concludes by suggesting that relief from these pressures can be found by challenging the notion of meritocracy and reevaluating the importance placed on external validation. They propose a shift towards a more compassionate and understanding society, where success is not solely defined by career achievements, and where individuals are valued for their intrinsic worth rather than their social standing.

Overall, the speaker highlights the societal factors that contribute to career anxiety and calls for a reevaluation of our values and priorities in order to alleviate this pressure and foster a more supportive and compassionate society.
