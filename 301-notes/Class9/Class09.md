# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing software by composing pure functions and avoiding shared state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of functions as the primary building blocks of programs.

A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always produces the same output and has no side effects. In simpler terms, it means that a pure function doesn't depend on or modify any external state and only operates on its input parameters. We can determine if a function is pure by checking if it meets these criteria.

1. Example of a Pure Function:

```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- Explanation: The `add` function takes two inputs (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. It doesn't modify any external state or have any side effects. For the same inputs, it always produces the same output. It adheres to the principle of being a pure function.

The benefits of pure functions are that they are predictable and reliable. Since they don't rely on external state, they provide consistent results and are easier to test. Pure functions also make it easier to reason about code since their behavior is isolated and self-contained.

- Immutability refers to the concept of not changing or modifying data once it is created. In functional programming, immutability is encouraged, and instead of modifying existing data, new data is created. This helps in writing more predictable and bug-free code since it eliminates unexpected changes to data.

2. Example of Immutability:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Create a new array with doubled values
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
```

- Explanation: The `map` method creates a new array (`doubledNumbers`) by applying a transformation function to each element of the original array (`numbers`). Instead of modifying the existing array, it creates a new one with the desired changes. This approach ensures immutability by avoiding direct modifications of the original data.

3. Example of Higher-Order Functions:

```
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```

Explanation: The `multiplyBy` function is a higher-order function that returns another function. It takes a `factor` as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a given `number` by that factor. This enables the creation of specialized functions (`double` and `triple`) by partially applying arguments to the higher-order function.

These code snippets demonstrate key concepts of functional programming, such as pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, and referential transparency. By applying these concepts, developers can write code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain.

- Referential transparency is a property that states that a function can be replaced with its resulting value without affecting the behavior of the program. In simpler terms, if a function always returns the same output for the same input, it can be substituted with its output throughout the codebase without changing the program's functionality.

4. Example of Referential Transparency:

```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(2, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 5
```

Explanation: In this example, the `add` function is referentially transparent because it can be replaced with its result (`5`) without changing the program's behavior. The `result` variable holds the value returned by `add(2, 3)`, and using `result` produces the same output as directly using `add(2, 3)`.

Functional programming is like building with Lego blocks. You use small, self-contained blocks (functions) to build larger structures (programs). A pure function is like a magic box that always gives the same result when you put the same things in it. It doesn't interact with anything outside the box, so it's safe and reliable. Immutability means treating data like precious treasures that you never change, but instead, you create new treasures whenever you need to modify them. Referential transparency is like having a superpower that lets you replace a function with its result without anyone noticing.

Imagine you have a toy robot kit. Each piece in the kit is like a function, and you can use these pieces to build different robots. A pure function is like a robot piece that always does the same thing when you attach it to other pieces. It doesn't need anything from the outside and doesn't change anything around it. This makes it easier to play with and test. Immutability is like having a set of special bricks that can't be changed once they are put together. You can build structures with these bricks, and they won't change or break unexpectedly. Referential transparency is like a magic spell. You can say the spell and get the result without needing to know how it works behind the scenes. You can use the spell anywhere, and it will always give you the same result.

By following these concepts, programmers can create reliable, predictable, and easy-to-understand programs, just like playing with Lego blocks or casting magical spells.

Sure! Here are the answers to your questions using the transcript from the Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require():

## Node, Modules and require()

1. What is a module?

    In Node.js, a module is a reusable block of code that encapsulates related functionality. It allows you to organize your code into separate files or modules, making it more modular and maintainable. Each module can have its own variables, functions, or classes, which can be exported and imported by other modules.

2. What does the word 'require' do?

    In Node.js, the `require` keyword is used to import or include modules in a file. It is a built-in function that allows you to load external modules or files that contain JavaScript code. When you use `require`, Node.js searches for the specified module in the `node_modules` folder or the built-in modules.

3. How do we bring another module into the file we are working in?

    To bring another module into the file you are working in, you use the `require` function and provide the path or name of the module you want to import. The module can be a built-in module, a module installed via npm, or a custom module defined in your project.

    Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to bring another module into your file:

    ```
    // Importing a built-in module
    const fs = require('fs');

    // Importing an installed module
    const express = require('express');

    // Importing a custom module
    const myModule = require('./myModule');
    ```

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

To make a module available for other files to import, you need to export the desired variables, functions, or classes from the module. This is done using the `module.exports` object in Node.js.

Here's an example code snippet that shows how to export variables and functions from a module:

```
// myModule.js
const greeting = 'Hello,';

function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`${greeting} ${name}!`);
}

module.exports = {
  greeting,
  sayHello,
};
```

In the above code, the `greeting` variable and the `sayHello` function are exported using the `module.exports` object. Other files can then import this module and access the exported values using `require`.
