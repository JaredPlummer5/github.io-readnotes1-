# Node

### What is node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on top of the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a way to execute JavaScript on the server-side, enabling the development of scalable and efficient web applications.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chrome team at Google. It is written in C++ and is responsible for executing JavaScript code in the Chrome web browser. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution, optimizing performance by utilizing just-in-time (JIT) compilation techniques.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

When we say that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it means that it provides an environment where JavaScript code can be executed. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, handling tasks such as file operations, network requests, and running web servers. It extends the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the browser, enabling developers to build server-side applications.

### What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to discover, install, and manage external libraries and packages for their Node.js projects. It provides access to a vast ecosystem of reusable code modules, making it easier to incorporate third-party functionality into Node.js applications.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

v19.9.0

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.6.3

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

To install the 'jshint' library/package using npm, you would typically open your command-line interface (such as the terminal) and type the following command:

- npm install jshint

This command will download and install the 'jshint' package from the npm registry and make it available for use in your Node.js project.

### What is node used for?

#### Node.js is used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Building web servers and web applications: Node.js provides a scalable and efficient platform for creating server-side applications, handling HTTP requests, and generating dynamic web content.

- Developing command-line tools: Node.js enables the creation of command-line applications, allowing developers to build utilities, scripts, and automation tools using JavaScript.
Real-time applications: Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications like chat systems, collaborative tools, and streaming applications that require fast and persistent connections.

- Building APIs: Node.js simplifies the creation of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for web services, allowing different applications to communicate and share data.

- Handling I/O operations: Node.js excels in handling I/O-intensive tasks, such as reading and writing files, interacting with databases, and making network requests, due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

## Pair programming

#### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- Greater code quality: Pair programming involves two developers working together on the same code, which leads to better code quality. The combined skills and knowledge of both programmers can catch mistakes, identify potential improvements, and produce more robust code.

- Knowledge sharing: Pair programming facilitates the exchange of knowledge between developers. Each person brings their unique experiences and expertise to the table, allowing them to learn from one another and expand their understanding of different programming techniques and concepts.

- Improved focus and productivity: With pair programming, developers can hold each other accountable and maintain focus on the task at hand. It minimizes distractions and encourages continuous engagement, resulting in improved productivity.

- Enhanced collaboration and communication: Pair programming promotes active collaboration and communication between developers. By discussing ideas, asking questions, and explaining concepts to each other, programmers can foster a stronger working relationship and ensure everyone is on the same page.

- Reduced debugging time: Since two programmers are involved in pair programming, they can catch bugs and issues more quickly. They can identify and fix problems as they arise, reducing the time spent on debugging during later stages of development.

- Better learning opportunities: Pair programming is an excellent platform for continuous learning. As developers work together, they can share insights, discover new approaches, and gain exposure to different coding styles. This environment fosters personal and professional growth.

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

In terms of the most beneficial reason, the benefits of pair programming can vary depending on the context and individuals involved. However, the aspect that often stands out as most beneficial is the improved code quality. The combined effort, knowledge, and scrutiny of two programmers can result in more reliable, maintainable, and efficient code.

## How does pair programming work?

Pair programming typically involves two programmers collaborating on a single computer. They take turns assuming the roles of the "driver" and the "navigator." The driver is responsible for actively writing the code, while the navigator provides guidance, reviews the code, and suggests improvements. The roles can be switched frequently to ensure both individuals actively participate in the development process.

Throughout the process, continuous communication is crucial. Developers discuss design decisions, share ideas, and provide feedback to one another. The goal is to leverage the collective intelligence and skills of both programmers to produce high-quality code efficiently.

It's important to note that pair programming is flexible, and different teams or individuals may have their own variations and adaptations of the practice based on their needs and preferences.
