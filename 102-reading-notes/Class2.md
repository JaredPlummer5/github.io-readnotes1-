## Setting Up Your computer

In today's class we set up our computers with our terminal. This process was too long to explain here but the link below can assist you in the step by step process.

## Text Editors and Terminal Navigation

### Text Editors

 A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
 your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
 allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
 to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
 important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

Most Important Features:

  1.) code completion
  
   2.) syntax highlighting - is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)

 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

#### Files

To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.

Please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they
have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. For
example, your main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” Your
CSS file should be called something like “style.css.” The filename isn’t
as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”).

`file` - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

`ls -a` - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

`1. Everything is a file under Linux`
 
 `-Even directories.`

`2. Linux is an extensionless system`
 
 `-Files can have any extension they like or none at all.`

`3. Linux is case sensitive`
 
 `-Beware of silly typos.`

### Terminal Navigation

Relative path- A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path- A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

`pwd` - Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

`ls`- List the contents of a directory.

`cd`- Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
