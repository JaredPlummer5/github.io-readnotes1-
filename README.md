>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all,
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET
