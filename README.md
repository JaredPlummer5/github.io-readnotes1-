# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset  is keeping a positive outlook on learning in general.
It's making every experience a learing experience. It's not allowing yourself to get 
discouraged based on what other people are doing. Just remember everyone is starting in different 
places so keep that in mind when you feel like you are struggling. When theses momentents arise 
*take a break and collect yourself*. Go outside, do something fun, hangout with friends then comeback and try again.
It's very important to give your brain a break and not let frustration get to you.

**Never** compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them

**Always** remember to give your brain a break

**Failure** is something to be prepared for and grow from

**Don't** be so prideful that you that you don't *ask for help*

>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all,
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET
