# Growth Mindset
**Never** compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them

**Always** remember to give your brain a break

**Failure** is something to be prepared for and grow from

**Don't** be so prideful that you that you don't *ask for help*

A growth mindset is keeping a positive outlook on learning in general.
It's making every experience a learing experience. It's not allowing yourself to get discouraged based on what other people are doing.
Justy remember everyone is starting in different places so keep that in mind when you feel like you are struggling. 
When theses momentents arise **take a break and collect yourself**. Go outside, do something fun,
>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all,
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET
