# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset  is keeping a positive outlook on learning in general.
It's making every experience a learing experience. It's not allowing yourself to get 
discouraged based on what other people are doing. Just remember everyone is starting in different 
places so keep that in mind when you feel like you are struggling. When theses momentents arise 
*take a break and collect yourself*. Go outside, do something fun, hangout with friends then comeback and try again.
It's very important to give your brain a break and not let frustration get to you.

**Never** compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them

**Always** remember to give your brain a break

**Failure** is something to be prepared for and grow from

**Don't** be so prideful that you that you don't *ask for help*

>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all,
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET

## Markdown

### What is Markdown?


Markdown is a simpler version of HTML. It syntax is much different. Markdown uses symbols to achive differernt formats.

For example, to create the Markdown header, you would need to type # Markdown

Matkdown is able to create many different things for example, Markdown can make list. The syntax for a list would be a dash then a space the any text in that order. You can see an example of this further down when we start talking about the formats of text.

Markdown is also capable of showcasing bold, italized, and a combination of the all of them.

-Bold letters would be two asterix on both side of selected text -Italic letter would be one asterix on both side of selected text -Bold and Italic letters would be three asterix on both side of selected text and one underscore on both sides of selected text

See examples below.

`** **` = Bold

`* *` = italics

`~ ~` = Strikthrough

`** ** and __ __` = Bold and nested italics

`*** ***` = Bold and italics

`<sub> </sub>` = Subscript

`<sup> </sup>` = smaller subscript


Moving on to images. Images can really pull a website together and with Markdown we can pull images from all over the internet.

The syntax for an image would be *an exclamation mark then square brackets with text inbetween and then round brackets with the url link inbetween.

You can make the text anything you want and the text will show up as the url link on your website.

`![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)`

And then we learned how to link a url link and attach it to our website.

The code for that would be square brackets with text inbetween and then round brackets with the url link inbetween.

You can make the text anything you want and the text will show up as the url link on your website.
